Code Career Academy - Initial ASP.NET Demo

Not sure what I did wrong this time but I was not able to push the project to GitHub. Instead I had to use my local directory as the origin and push to GitHub. This finally worked after several failed attempts to use the traditional clone method.
This is the first project I have used a .gitignore file with. Additionally, the project was saved to a dir 'src' rather than directly to the folder. 
One day...I'll know why this happened.
